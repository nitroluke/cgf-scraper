My wife needed to copy and paste links from a modal in a table to convert an old site to a new one for work.

So I quickly/slopily made this to help make her life a little easier.

Things this does:

  - parses file names and formats links
  - generates iframe from youtube id.
  - pretty prints all of the data for a table row including the modal info to a file for easy viewing.
